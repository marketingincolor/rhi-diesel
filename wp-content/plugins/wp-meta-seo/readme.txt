Editing meta information on an existing website can be veeeery long, open each post, edit, close it, open again and almost nobody was doing it. Especially if you need to edit content + image meta.
WP Meta SEO is going to list all posts, pages, custom post types and all images. Type your meta content and fix image size and everything is AJAX saved.
Plus, a bulk copy feature is available to save tons of time in your SEO optimization process:
* Content title to All meta titles (optional meta keywords)
* Image name to Image title
* Image name to Image alt
* Optional keyword edition

A bunch of people reduce the size of the pictures in content using handles that results to a HTML resizing. And that's something wrong for SEO, for page loading time and for image quality.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will the image rename bulk feature generate broken links? =
Not at all, it would have been bad for SEO :) the image name is dynamically replaced in all your content.

There's an SEO option for that :) WP Meta SEO will detect that the image has missing information and once edit it, you will have a list of all the image instance and where it's loaded.
So you'll be able to define SEO info for each instance.
